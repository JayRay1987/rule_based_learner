#summary of model
summary(mushroom_1R)
#examining the table we see that 1R classifier classified 120 poisonous mushrooms
#as edible. A big mistake!
#0 edible mushrooms were misclassified as poisonous.
#as it only used one feature I guess it is a positive start.
#let's try a more sophisticated learner, namely: JRip.
#first train the model
mushroom_JRip <- JRip(type ~., data =mushrooms)
#examine the rules
mushroom_JRip
#9 rules to distinguish poisonous mushrooms from edible mushrooms.
#for example, if type odor is foul then mushroom is poisonous.
#for example, if gill size is narrow and odor is pungent then mushroom is poisonous.
#if mushroom doesn't meet one of these rules then we can say mushroom is edible.
